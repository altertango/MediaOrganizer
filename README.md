# MediaOrganizer
A video and photo organizer for reddit user u/Scoop2100.

This is a python-tkinter app that previews pictures and videos with buttons to move/copy them into specific folders.
At the beginning it will let you choose the input directory (including subdirectories) and as many output directories as you like
When you click on the "Go" button it will iterate through your media inside the input folder and you can choose to send it to one of your input folders or to trash.

I did it in python 3.9.12, you will need to install the following additional libraries:
numpy
opencv-python
PIL
send2trash
